Monitor Realtime runs every 10 mins, pulls the latest data generated by ILOFAR, makes a 
dynamic spectra and lightcurve and stores it in a monitor folder located in the observation
folder. 

These figures are then used by www.lofar.ie/research-monitoring displaying them as a gallery.(Developed by Nathan Simoncini) 

files needed:
	lofar_bst.py   : Developed by Pearse Murphy. Handles bst files from ilofar
	lofar_monitor.py: Developed by Alberto Canizares. Uses lofar_bst to plot the dynamic spectra and lightcurves.
	lofar_monitor.sh: Developed by Alberto Canizares. Runs 24/7 calling lofar_monitor.py
